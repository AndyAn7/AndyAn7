## Bio

  Welcome to my Hub! I've recently begun the process of immersing myself in computer science with an aim to take part in the advance of humanity via technology and the data derived within. In time, I intend on entering into the field of web development upon the foundation of Full-Stack execution ability; thenceforth, I plan to study and perform my way into the field of data science to take part in the apex of technology as is current, Artificial Intelligence.

  Here, at this juncture of my path into computer science, I present basic assignments and projects I've completed, or taken part in completing, during my time as a student at the University of Washington's Full-Stack Boot Camp program.

  Though these are all works of progress towards my ultimate goal within Tech, I hope that you find yourself within good-impression as you peruse through my Hub.
  
  Thanks!
